## Introduction

This Python script is designed to detect the white ball in an input image and calculate which of the detected circles is closest to it. It utilizes the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks and NumPy for numerical operations.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
